# Language-Analysis---Identifier

Hi Everyone! Made this in my DS class, thought it was a pretty cool concept.

Input file must be a plain text file. In that file you can have the name's and corresponding text files listed and the program
will teach itself to identify via the "known" languages you identify, and the "unknown" language files you don't.
Then it will create an output text file for you identifying which text files were unknown and which languages its most
associated.

Notice: The program won't "work" or identify which language the "unknown" is if it's not able to build its own understanding
via the files you fed it prior. The input file should have as many "known" language files if you want it to be smart enough
to identify un-identified languages.
